This repo aims to develop a basic system framework for a Visual Novel Game, including UI design, text reading and typewriter effects, automatic playback and skipping, saving and loading and other functions.


04/17 Add "Final_credits_scroller", "Intro_logo_fadein" and "Menu_Bgm". The audio system will soon be built. The save_load function will be fixed next.

04/04 The whole scene framework is updating so the save_load function is temporally unavailable.
